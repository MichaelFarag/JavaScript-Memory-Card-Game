## How to Play

1- The objective is to collect the most pairs of cards.

2- If they successfully match a pair they get to keep the cards, and that player gets another turn.

3- When a player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same position)

4-The trick is to remember which cards are where.
